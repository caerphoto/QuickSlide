#QuickSlide

QuickSlide is a simple JavaScript popup image viewer, ideal for lightweight
gallery pages.

Adding it to a page is simple:

1. Include the `quickslide.js` file at the bottom of your page:
        <script src="quickslide.js"></script>

2. Mark your thumbnail image links with `rel="quickslide"`:
        <a href="myphoto_big.jpg" rel="quickslide">
		    <img src="myphoto_thumb.jpg">
		</a>
