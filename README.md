#QuickSlide

QuickSlide is a basic JavaScript popup image viewer, ideal for lightweight
gallery pages.

##Usage

1. Include the `quickslide.js` (or the minified equivalent) file at the bottom of your page:

        <script src="quickslide.js"></script>

2. Add `rel="quickslide"` to any links you want to convert to popups:

        <a href="images/buslane_b.jpg" rel="quickslide">
          <img src="images/buslane_t.jpg"/>Bus Lane
        </a>
Make sure these links point to images, otherwise QuickSlide will get confused.

That's it! QuickSlide is designed to be an unobtrusive, progressive enhancement to existing pages: it won't interfere with other JavaScript widgets or libraries, and your page won't break if for some reaon the code fails to load. It will also work on any links added to a page dynamically via JavaScript.

##Configuration
There are a few options you can specify to control the behaviour of the popups. They are set using a `<script>` tag anywhere before the inclusion of the main `quickslide.js` file, like so:

    <script>
    QuickSlideConfig = {
      max_width: 800,
      max_height: 600,
      use_dimmer: true,
      absolute_position: true,
      show_caption: true,
      auto_fit: false }
    </script>

    <script src="quickslide.js"></script>

The options specified in this example are currently the only ones available. An explanation of the options:

* `max_width`, `max_height`: dimensions are in pixels. Specifying either will constrain the popup image to that size, maintaining aspect ratio. You can specify both. No default.

* `use_dimmer`: set to `true` to also create a fixed-position `<div>` in addition to the popup box itself. It has an ID of `quickslide-dimmer`, is fixed-position and covers the whole window. Default value for this option is `false`.

* `absolute_position`: set to `true` to make the popup scroll with the document. Default is `false`, which means the popup stays in the centre of the browser window even when you scroll up or down (i.e. it is displayed with `position: fixed style`).

* `show_caption`: set to `true` to use the source link's `title` attribute as a caption for the popup image. You can use HTML in the title and it will be inserted as normal on the caption. Default is `false`. The caption is a `<div>` with an ID of `quickslide-caption`.

* `auto_fit`: set this to `false` to allow popups to be larger than the browser window. Default is `true`.

You can (and should) use CSS to customise the appearance of the popup and associated elements â€“ see the [demo page] and its [CSS file] for an example.
